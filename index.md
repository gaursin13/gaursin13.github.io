# Hi, I’m Gaurav

I’m a Data Science and AI graduate from Columbia University, passionate about using machine learning to solve real-world problems and unlock long-term impact. I believe in AI's power to uplift individuals—especially those like me, who started with little but found opportunity through technology.
